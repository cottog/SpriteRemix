# Sprite Remix

Project initially intended to be used to make sprites/pixel art. Planned to add more tools, and support for layers, with a few extras.

## Purpose

Right now, you can simply edit a fixed-size bitmap image, pixel-by-pixel. This image cannot be saved, nor can you edit the size, but you can choose a color and edit each pixel singly, or with a flood-fill tool as well as a circle tool.

I plan to add more tools (line, rectangle, etc.), and support for layering. I also plan to add a means to procedurally generate the same sprite with multiple colorways, or sprites with different features selected from multiple options eligible on a layer. As this functionality isn't implemented, it might difficult to grasp what exactly that means, or how it might be helpful, but I plan to use it to re-generate sprites for a future roguelike project to ensure that the art changes with each playthrough.
